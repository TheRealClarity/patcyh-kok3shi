# Patcyh-kok3shi

This build supports arm64, 7.0+ only. It assumes iOS 9 and above are running an unstashed environment and does not hard modify the lsd and installd binaries, like the original version does.
Please DO NOT install this when running an iOS 9 stashed and untethered jailbreak since THIS WILL BREAK YOUR UICACHE!
